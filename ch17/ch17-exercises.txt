== Exercise 17-1 ==
** Question **
Write a program that displays the permissions from the ACL entry that
corresponds to a particular user or group.  The program should take
two command-line arguments.  The first argument is iether of the
letters u or g, indicating whether the second argument identifies a
user or group.  (The functions defined in Listing 8-1, on page 159, can
be used to allow the second command-line argument to be specified
numerically or as a name.)  If the ACL entry that corresponds to the
given user or group falls into the group class, then the program
should additionally display the permissions that would apply after
the ACL entry has been modified by the ACL mask entry.

** Answer **
