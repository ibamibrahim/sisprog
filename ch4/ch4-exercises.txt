== Exercise 4-1 ==
Question:
The tee command reads its standar input until end-of-file, writing a
copy of the input to standard output and to the file named in its
command-line argument.  (We show an example of the use of this command
hwne we discuss FIFOs in Section 44.7.)  Implement tee using I/O
system calls.  By default, tee overwites any existing file with the
given name.  Impelment the -a command-line option (tee -a file), which
casuses te to append text to the end of a file  if it already exists.
(Refer to Appendix B for desription ofthe getopt() function, which can
be used to parse command-line options.)

See tee.c (prog_tee output from scons)

Write a program like cp that, when used to copy a regular file that
contains holes (sequences of null bytes), also creates correspdonding
holes in the target file.
